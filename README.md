* Using a forked version of SnipMate. See --> http://bit.ly/WbckOj
* Ctrl-w is awesome
* Check into https://drupal.org/node/1389448 to see drupalvim stuff

#### Todo
* E486: Pattern not found: 666 --> can't open splits
* tComment is doing it wrong for scss
* Install phpcs and set Drupal as default syntax
* Using redundant scss plugins -- mebbe this is a bad idea
