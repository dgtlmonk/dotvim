## Notes
* To update plugins --> git submodule foreach git pull origin master

* Check into https://drupal.org/node/1389448 to see drupalvim stuff
* Install drupalvim with Drush
* ./install.sh --clang-completer to install YouCompleteMe

#### Todo
* E486: Pattern not found: 666 --> can't open splits
* tComment is doing it wrong for scss
* Install phpcs and set Drupal as default syntax
* Using redundant scss plugins -- mebbe this is a bad idea
